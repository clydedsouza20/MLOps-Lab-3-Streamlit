Institution: Northeastern University, Boston

Program: MS in Data Analytics Engineering

📌 Project Overview
This repository contains a customized MLOps dashboard built with Streamlit. Moving beyond the standard introductory labs, this project implements a predictive engine for wine quality assessment using the Scikit-Learn Wine dataset.

Key Modifications from Base Lab:
Dataset: Shifted from Iris (Classification) to Wine (Regression-style scoring).

Architecture: Implemented a Random Forest Regressor to provide continuous quality scores.

UI/UX: Custom CSS branding, dual-column layout, and interactive bar charts for feature distribution analysis.

Performance: Utilized @st.cache_resource for optimized model loading.
